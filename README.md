A new OECD report, The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution,
estimates that outdoor air pollution will cause 6-9 million premature deaths
annually by 2060, compared to three million in 2010. That is equivalent to a
person dying every 4-5 seconds. Cumulatively, more than 200 million people
will die prematurely in the next 45 years as a result of air pollution.

In this project AQI at different location is graded as per EPA and colour coded.
The pollution trend at different times of the year is determined using Apache spark.
These trends can give guidance on atmospheric pollution conditions and help to make plan on outdoor activities.
